opensky-tools
=============

opensky-tools is a set of utilities that work with OpenSky transaction
data.

opensky2qif.py
    Converts a payment-details CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
    exported from OpenSky -> Account -> Payments to a QIF (Quicken
    Interchange Format) file.  The default is a command line
    interface, but you can specify --gui to use a GUI interface.
