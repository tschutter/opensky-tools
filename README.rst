opensky-tools
=============

opensky-tools is a set of utilities that work with OpenSky transaction
data.

opensky2qif.py
    Converts a .csv (Comma Separated Value) file exported from OpenSky
    to a .qif (Quicken Interchange Format) file.  The default is a
    command line interface, but you can specify --gui to use a GUI
    interface.
